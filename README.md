# marl-anomaly-detect
### This project tests multiple different machine learning algorithms that can detect adversarial attacks in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings. Baselines were used to compare performance of a proposed ensemble model. Then, using FGSM, we re-attacked the ensemble detection model with perturbed observations. Read more at the pdf titled LischkeSeniorThesisFinal.

Of the machines tested, there were:
  -Knearest Neighbors
  -Random Forest
  -SVM
  -Binary Dense Neural Network
  -Binary LSTM Neural Network
  -Proposed stacked ensemble of Binary LSTM and predictive LSTMs
