# marl-anomaly-detect
### This project tests multiple different machine learning algorithms that can detect adversarial attacks in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings. Baselines were used to compare performance of a proposed ensemble model. Then, using FGSM, we re-attacked the ensemble detection model with perturbed observations.
